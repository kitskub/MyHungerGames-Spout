Yes i know what you are thinking...Another Hunger Games plugin? Really? 
Well i will assure you that this plugin attempts to do what no other Hunger Games plugin does...
All of them wanted to be small, allowing you only to create one, but what if you wanted to create multiple games, 
allowing you to host the biggest Hunger Games tournament ever. 
This plugin does simple things like freezing players when they join, leave, and allows you to kick other players, 
BUT this plugin also allows you to sponsor items to players (items defined in the config), 
fills chests with random items (also defined in the config).
